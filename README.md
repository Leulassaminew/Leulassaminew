<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Leul</h1>

  <b>Senior AI/ML Engineer (6+ years)</b> • LLMs • RAG • Fine-tuning • Deployment
</p>

## About
I build production AI systems end-to-end, from data and modeling to evaluation, serving, and monitoring.  
My core focus is **LLMs and applied ML**: RAG pipelines, agentic workflows, fine-tuning open-source models, and deploying reliable, cost-efficient services.

## What I do (high level)
- **LLMs & RAG:** ingestion → chunking → indexing → retrieval/reranking → citations + evaluation
- **Agentic workflows:** tool-use/function calling, structured outputs, guardrails, fallbacks
- **Fine-tuning & optimization:** PEFT/LoRA, dataset prep, evaluation harnesses, prompt CI
- **Model serving:** FastAPI microservices, Docker, CI/CD, monitoring, latency/cost tuning
- **Quantization & efficiency:** batching/caching, quantized inference for robust deployments
- **NLP & CV:** text classification, document intelligence/OCR patterns, vision pipelines (incl. Stable Diffusion workflows)

## Tech stack (compact)
**Python • PyTorch • TensorFlow • FastAPI • Docker • SQL • Vector DBs (Pinecone/FAISS/pgvector) • AWS/Azure/GCP**

## Open to
- LLM Engineer / AI Engineer / ML Engineer roles (remote or hybrid)
- Collaborations on **LLM apps, RAG systems, and applied NLP/CV**
